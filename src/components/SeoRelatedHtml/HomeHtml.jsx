          <p>
            I’m Eduard, a Full-Stack developer from Romania, with a focus on
            building dynamic and engaging web experiences. I love working at the
            intersection of design and functionality, where I can create
            seamless user interfaces that feel intuitive and look aesthetic. A
            big part of my process involves continuous research and
            experimentation, which lets me bring fresh ideas and solid results
            to every project I work on.
          </p>
          <p>My tech stack, just to name a few examples, includes:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <strong>Front-End:</strong> React, NextJS, Expo
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Back-End:</strong> NodeJS, NestJS, Express
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Databases:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Styling:</strong> TailwindCSS
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I’m eager to take on new projects, solve problems, and work with
            others to build something meaningful. If you appreciate my work and
            are looking for someone who’s dedicated and adaptable, let us
            discuss how we can work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let&apos;s connect and create something that leaves a lasting
            impression!
